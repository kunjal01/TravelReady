<h1>Ahmedabad</h1>
<p id="font1">Ahmedabad, also known as Amdavad, was named after Sultan Ahmed Shah, who founded the city in 1411. It is one of the major cities of Gujarat. It served as the capital of Gujarat from 1960 to 1970. Ahmedabad has a strong association with India’s struggle for independence. Mahatma Gandhi lived in Ahmedabad for several years and it was from here that he started the Dandi March, also known as the Salt March, an act of non-violent resistance and civil disobedience against British rule in India.Located on the banks of the Sabarmati River, the city of Ahmedabad built its fortune on the thriving textile industry, which earned it the nickname ‘Manchester of the East’. Notwithstanding its attraction as a business destination, Ahmedabad, the largest city in Gujarat remains steeped in history and has a wealth of historical attractions.</p>

<p>Set in the quiet village of Adalaj, 19 km from Ahmedabad, this step well or ‘vav’ has served as a resting place for many pilgrims and caravans along their trade routes.This was not just a cultural and utilitarian space, but also a spiritual refuge. It is believed that villagers would come everyday in the morning to fill water, offer prayers to the deities carved into the walls and interact with each other in the cool shade of the vav. The stepwell has three entrance stairs and is a spectacular example of Indo-Islamic architecture and design with intricate Islamic floral patterns and Hindu and Jain symbolism.</p>
