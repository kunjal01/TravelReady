<h1>Bangalore</h1>
<p id="font1">The capital of Karnataka State, Bengaluru, also known as the 'City of Gardens', is one of the most attractive cities in India with its beautiful parks, avenues and impressive buildings. Historically known as Vengaluru, Bendakaluru (village of boiled beans) and as the anglicized Bangalore, Bengaluru has moved to be city that is cosmopolitan in nature and a nerve center of the Arts and Culture as well. The once-sedate cantonment settlement of the British has now spread way beyond the mud fort and the four towers constructed by Kempe Gowda in 1537. With its booming economy and racy lifestyle, the capital of Karnataka has metamorphosed from a sleepy Garden City into one of India's fastest growing, accommodating and cosmopolitan cities. Bengaluru is a city of contrasts, going by several other aliases: India's Silicon Valley, Pub City, Shopper's Paradise, Garden City, Air-conditioned City, Gourmet's Delight, Pub Hopper's Paradise, Pensioners Paradise, IT and BT City and Shopper's Hot Spot. Surrounded by weekend getaways, Bengaluru makes an ideal hub for visitors who want to travel to the many hill stations and coastal towns of South India.</p>
