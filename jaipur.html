<h1>Jaipur</h1>
<p id="font1">The city of palaces and forts, interspersed with historical monuments and gardens that testify the grandeur of the Rajput kings, Jaipur is the gateway to the royal heritage of India. Also called Pink City, the capital of Rajasthan, remains suspended in time, with its heritage preserved in the overwhelming Hawa Mahal that gazes down at the bustling streets of Johari Bazaar.
A little away from the city centre, which is resplendent with state-of-the-art cinemas/ movie theatres, eateries, multiplexes, museums and parks, lies the arid hilly country dotted with forts that earlier stood as armoured sentinels of Jaipur. The biggest and the most awe-inspiring is the Amber Fort, which leaves one humbled with its expansive fortifications and grandeur.</p>

<p>One of the most ethereal sights in Jaipur is the architectural marvel of Jal Mahal, which is standing right at the centre of the Man Sagar Lake. It is built according to a blend of Rajput and Mughal aesthetics, with pink sandstone. The sandstone paints a vivid image against the blue backdrop of the water and the distant rolling hills. The palace is a five-storeyed building and about four storeys stay immersed when the lake is full. At night, bathed in dreamy lights, the palace seems as if it’s floating in the lake's water. In the vicinity of the palace is the gorgeous Chameli Bagh, which is a paradise for birdwatchers. </p>
