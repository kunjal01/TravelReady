<h1>Mumbai</h1>
<p id="font1">Mumbai, the capital of Maharashtra, attracts dreamers with sky-high ambitions from every corner of the country. It is a unique place where the past is mixed with the future and history meets modernity, a city that lies at the cross section of business and entertainment and beats to a pulsating rhythm of its own. Located by the Arabian Sea, Mumbai is an amalgamation of heritage and culture and glitz and glamour. So from historic art deco buildings, which are recognised by the UNESCO, to plush new-age homes of the super rich, Mumbai has it all!  </p>

<p>Less than an hour's boat ride from the Gateway of India, in Colaba, lies the Elephanta Island. The island owes its global popularity to the fact that it is home to a network of ancient rock-cut caves known as the Elephanta caves that boast artistic wall carvings and sculptures, dedicated to Hindu and Buddhist gods.  The most intricately detailed and architecturally majestic cave, among the Elephanta network is situated on Gun Hill. The panels on these caves depict the lives and beliefs of the esoteric Pashupati sect of the Shaiva system. </p>

<p>A walk down the beautiful sea facing promenade, Marine Drive, is a must-do, when in Mumbai. This road has been given the nickname Queen's necklace because at night, the street lights along this curving three and a half kilometre long road create the illusion of a string of pearls around a neck. The sight of sparkling waters of the Arabian Sea combined with the cool, fresh breeze that blows in, makes this area one of the most exclusive and expensive real estate hubs in Mumbai.</p>

<p>This national park, on the periphery of Mumbai, is an ecological paradise rich in plant and animal life. Hosting over 254 species of birds, 40 species of mammals, 78 species of reptiles and amphibians, 150 species of butterflies and over 1,300 species of plants, the Sanjay Gandhi National Park holds many attractions for naturalists, birdwatchers and tourists across the globe. The best thing about the park is about 103 sq km of pure wilderness, right in the heart of a bustling city. The rich biodiversity of this park owes much to its lakes, which were constructed in the 19th century.</p>
